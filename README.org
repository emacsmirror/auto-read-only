* auto-read-only.el
Automatically make the buffer-file to read-only based on =buffer-file-name=.
For example, it can protect library code provided by third parties.

** Setup
put into your own =.emacs= file (=init.el=)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'auto-read-only)
(auto-read-only-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Customize

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Third party codes are installed in vendor/ directory.
(add-to-list 'auto-read-only-file-regexps "/vendor/")
#+END_SRC

** Competitor
[[https://github.com/rolandwalker/hardhat][hardhat]] is a package similar to =auto-read-only.el=.
It has large default settings, more flexible and has compatibility with a wide range of Emacs versions.

=auto-read-only= works with a simple mechanism based on hook.
It provides a minor mode, but it is not important.
It also does not interfere with the behavior of non-interactive Emacs Lisp codes (ex. =package-install=).
